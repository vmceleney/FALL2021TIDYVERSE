Introduction to the fantastic Purrr package. This tidyverse package provides users a great framework for working with lists, nested lists, and json lists. Purrr makes it easy to do things like:

- mapping functions across a list
- extracting data from nested lists
- creating dataframes from nested lists
- and much more
